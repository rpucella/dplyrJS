# dplyrJS

A Javascript implementation of Hadley Wickham's [dplyr package](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) for data manipulation in R.

## Installation

All the code is contained in `dplyr.js` for simplicity. The file
exports its content using the CommonJS module specification, so it can
be used in a NodeJS project. Eventually, I'll create an npm entry for it. 

You can also use the file directly via a line 

    <script src="dplyr.js"></script>

in your HTML file, making the content of `dplyr.js` available to the
other scripts on your page.
